# ALPHA RESEARCH AND MULTI-FACTOR MODEL

## OBJECTIVE
> Portfolio Optimization.
* I built a statistical risk model using PCA. \ 
* Used this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. \
* Created these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. \
* At the end of the project, I optimized the portfolio using the risk and factor models using multiple optimization formulations.
